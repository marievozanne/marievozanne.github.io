```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
```

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(mosaic)
options("pillar.sigfig" = 10) # print 10 significant digits in summarize output

# Iris Flowers Example

Conduct a claim of the test that the population mean sepal width is the same for all three species.

$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3$

$H_A:$ it is not the case that all three means are equal.

#### Any approach will start off by fitting the full model

```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.height = 1.5, fig.width = 7}
full_fit <- lm(Sepal.Width ~ Species, data = iris)
```

#### Option 1: F statistic and p-value at bottom of model summary

```{r}
summary(full_fit)
```

#### Option 2: Call `anova` on your model fit

```{r}
anova(full_fit)
```

#### Option 3: Fit a reduced model and call `anova`, supplying both the full and reduced models.

For the reduced model, our explanatory variable is "1" -- which means, include only an intercept.

```{r}
reduced_fit <- lm(Sepal.Width ~ 1, data = iris)
anova(reduced_fit, full_fit)
```

This third approach is too much work for the current example, but it is necessary in the examples we will look at next week.
