# Example: Crab species identification

We will work with a data set about Leptograpsus crabs originally presented in

Campbell, N.A. and Mahon, R.J. (1974) A multivariate study of variation in two species of rock crab of genus Leptograpsus. Australian Journal of Zoology 22, 417â€“425.

They have also been discussed previously in

Venables, W. N. and Ripley, B. D. (2002) Modern Applied Statistics with S. Fourth edition. Springer.

There are two species of this crab; we will examine the effect of certain physical dimenions on crab species.  The data we are working with contains 5 morphological measurements on 200 crabs, 100 each of two species of Leptograpsus crabs collected at Fremantle, W. Australia.

The variables in this data set are as follows:

 * `sp`: species - "B" or "O" for blue or orange.
 * `sex`: the crab's sex
 * `FL`: frontal lobe size (mm).
 * `RW`: rear width (mm).
 * `CL`: carapace length (mm).
 * `CW`: carapace width (mm).
 * `BD`: body depth (mm).
 
For purposes of this example, we will only focus on species and frontal lobe size.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(MASS)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(caret)
set.seed(478)
crabs <- MASS::crabs[sample.int(nrow(crabs)), ]
crabs <- crabs %>% dplyr::select(-index)
```

#### Binary encoding of response variable

Typically in logistic regression, we use an indicator variable for the response variable:

\begin{align*}
Y_i &= \begin{cases} 1 & \text{ if crab number $i$ is an orange crab} \\ 0 & \text{ otherwise (if a blue crab)} \end{cases}
\end{align*}

```{r}
crabs <- crabs %>%
  mutate(
    sp_01 = ifelse(sp == "O", 1, 0)
  )
head(crabs)
dim(crabs)
```

### Plot of the data

```{r fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = crabs, mapping = aes(x = FL, y = sp_01)) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw()
```

### Fit logistic regression model

Note:

 * Behind the scenes, `sp` is converted to 0/1 representation by the glm function
 * By default, assignment is in alphabetic order, so "B" goes to 0 and "O" goes to 1.
 
```{r}
logistic1 <- glm(sp_01 ~ FL, data=crabs, family = binomial)
```


### Print model summary

```{r}
summary(logistic1)

## Effect of FL on species odds
exp(logistic1$coefficients[2])
```

### Plot of the data with logistic regression model fit

This curve represents the estimated probability that a crab is orange, as a function of frontal lobe size (mm).

```{r fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = crabs, mapping = aes(x = FL, y = sp_01)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="glm", method.args=list(family="binomial"), se=FALSE) +
  theme_bw()
```

#### 1. Based on this model, how could you calculate the estimated probability that a crab with a frontal lobe size of 15 mm is orange?

\vspace{2cm}

\emph{Method 1}

```{r}
b_hat <- matrix(logistic1$coefficients)
X <- matrix(c(1,15), nrow=1)

exp(X%*%b_hat)/(1+exp(X%*%b_hat))
```

\emph{Method 2}

```{r}
predict_data <- data.frame(
  FL = 15
)
predict(logistic1, newdata=predict_data, type="response")
```


#### 2. What is the interpretation of $\hat{\beta}_1$ in terms of odds?

\vspace{3cm}

#### 3. What is the estimated relationship between the odds that a crab with a frontal lobe of 10 mm is orange versus a crab with a frontal lobe of 20 mm is orange?

\vspace{2cm}

```{r}
X <- cbind(c(1,1),
           c(10,20))
exp(X[2,]%*%b_hat)/exp(X[1,]%*%b_hat)
exp(b_hat[2]*10)
```

#### 4. Mathematical check - why are these both valid ways to calculate the estimated relationship?
