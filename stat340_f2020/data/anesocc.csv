I think laor unions have complicated and inflated the cost of things that would help American get back to work. I understand the basis for some of their work and I think they have gone overboard and I certainly don't believe them being n the teaching profession. // I thin the labor unions associated with education have puttoo many rules in place with not weeding out tenue teachers that are not good and our children suffer. I feel like their should be an option to join or not join. The cost of them driving up the service costs is a problem and I ahve seen it more in the news and actually in this city. //No;Fical conservatist. // their support of the military seems stronger at times.//I like the fact that they initially had more women at high in their party. those are my strongest 3 points.;I do not like the extreme conservatism that appears to be racist. // Here in CA in [REDACTED CITY NAME] one of the Republican leaders sent out an e-mail [REDACTED DETAILS] and it was sent from their office. I find this distest, disrepectful, and I do not see the disrespect that I am seeing from the other party. I did not see this when President Bush was President. There is a contract that was signed with the Republican party members which adheres them to an extreme point of view and they can not compromise, and I think this is what has caused the deadlock in Congress so they can not do what their constituency wants and they want to do what the people want them to do.

important to me.// i think lastly just the importance he and his administration places on the adequate social safety nets on the importance of governmental programs//;my one hesitation would have been he seemed somewhat less effective than i was hoping around cerian economic innitiative the economy staying a relatively poor state, made me take pause. this never would have switched me to votin for

he was trying to seek conseus with the republicans. they didn't go far enough to be affective//;his apparent idialogy that in  a free market that the economic situation.can improve with a little less

his stances on social issues I don't feel is right. he against marriage equality, his stance on abortion and womans right to choose, just the fact that he seems to have flip flopped over the past several years where he stands and what would advocate as prisediont lack of clarity around what he believes is troubling to me. in addition romneys pandering to the tea party extreme conservatism is troubling to me because of that camp or group of people are people i perceive to be people that can not think with enough nuance to really understand how their decisions effect the american people//a big thing is the republican parties instance that we are a christian nation and that religion should be more a part of politics today.//;i think more socially liberal attitudes, and i think for the

The main thing is clear in the country is the war on terror, i think the country is a lot safer. I was working in [REDACTED CITY NAME] when 911 occurred seeing things live there in person it's tragic, right, and catching someone that is hiding forever, consistently pursuing someone and accomplishing it.  His agenda improving education, schools, public service I was just commenting with my wife, I realize that PBS, the channel that kids wat, I realize they are very useful that my childrens age is nice to have, it puts them in an advantage, its a very educational show.  I guess in his debate he made a better point than his opponent Romney with his plans to improve Universitites, teachers, students.  3. Coming from my background a very poor i guess low income hardworking class, my parents and I we were hard workers in middle class because the majority of my family are either middler class or lower class tht the ideas he expressed in his deba;unemployment, 2. maybe it's me but I'm not aware of his strategy on gun control I know in his debate he mentioned that's addressed every=thing comes from educationa nd family values, but that cannot be the answer to everything.There should be a sedcond plan on family values, his answer was reactive instead of proactive. being proactive is better. you minimize the current violence that is happendning every day out there. putting technology, not just education.  I'm process driven, that putting a a fix to this problem, gun control, etc. is easily attained putting meassures in the manufacturers so these things don't happen.;1. someone new, new change basically, nes ideas. the current president i don't feel we are better off than we were 4 years ago . unemployment, all the facts that come up 4 years later, statistics, facts of what he has accomplished make me feel that a newchange, giving somone the opportunity can help us, right?  2. I like his proposal on fair trade and Romney's debates he mentioned something that interested me put in rules in China make sure there is a comparitive equaalness between imports and exports. 3. In Romney's debate he mentioned about Latin America being forgotten, missed, not thought of as the industry or sector toinvest in, LA has , he mentioned a lot of resources, agricultural, language, time zone, geografic, demografics that all it gives facts pros, more pros in the LA country.  Being LA I wasn't expecting Romney to say that. I thought it was right on. I agree with all the points he mentioned.  Since I'm [REDACTED DETAILS], I know we outsource a lot of our jobs to India, Phi;Unfortunatly I'm embarrased to say this but I've read about him I know he is very religious, and because of his religion is something that kind of stereotipical I think it is a dissadvantage.  His religion I guess. and I'm not racist, or stereotyping, myparents being latino, most of us catholic. I really have not dealt with indivuals in that religion.  It's something that is questionable. and again I'm embarrased to say that. Another item even more important is the fact that even though he seems to comewith new ideas like China ruels in place with imports and exports, i think his ideas are easier said than done and unreachable.  I don't think he has clarified how he wants to get there. I'm not aware or he made it clear how we are going to get there.;Their plans, during election and stragedies and ideas kind of are in my comfort zone. Although their ideas are not revolutionizing, no drastic changes, there are small changes and I feel more comfortable with their strategies. they are always very close to the middle class and lower class, and being latin, i just feel more comfortable with that.  Education  is just something about them, not increasing taxes for high income families thats always a big win for me in the democratic party.;I think one ot two, there's not many, but in the last few years, I think the DP had done better with the Latin American community.  the Arizona law out there. the DP demostrates the partnership with the latin community, their transparency to the Latin communityies can be improved, the arizona law is there and it has to go thru the senate, but they could have talked to the people. the fundamental of the consitution is free speech, anti racism, and I think that categorizing and stereotping indicivuduals inunfair and wrong.;I think overall every election the republican party always they come up with great stragedies, plans, improvements, health care fiancial, economic, they come up with great ideas but i don't know about individuals representing them.  I have not been impressed with the Bushes, I think REagan was a great president.  They have not had the person to represent them.  Their plans and ideas are great, I jusr have not been imprressed with their candidate.;The last election, their leaders have not impressed me, it's dessapointed me, i have not a good felling about a republican candidate yet.  i have consistently voted democratic even though I'm not 100 for them, I haven't seen the right representation in leadership for that party.;;;;;;;;;;Finance Manager;Investment Banking;Superintedent of the power company//electical power company//Private company//;;;;;eggs n bacon;;1772;;;;;;;Obama is a moderate and he is the right candidate that reflects Americas reality in terms of the economics, social and cultural and foreign policy from a global perspective.;;;I think he is far right and conservative.

Israel is right to exist in that region.  I believe that his experience in economics and investment probably did prepare him to be an efficient leader and someone who knows a lot about economic policy. He seems like a nice family man, politically I can't think of a lot more than that.;I don't trust him at all. I think he's an out of touch wealthy politician who would say anything to get elected and has been caught on tape essentially admitting in so many words that he is a racist. He chose Paul Ryan as a running mate, that decision inand of itself was enough to make me know I don't want to vote for him. He fundamentally believes that more than 50 percent  percent of this country are shiftless layabouts who aren't interested in working.  That's obviously the view of someone whose mind is out of touch with what's going on in this country. He's a misogynist.;They generally are supportive of domestic spending, specifically on research and technology, and education. They tend to lean toward a more reserved approach to foreign policy, less aggressive, they tend to be people who are more emphathetic and care fortheir fellow man, which is mostly good;They tend to be faster to raise taxes. They have a tendency toward extreme idealism.  That can be dangerous because not everyone wants to be or can be saved by entitlement programs.;They have adopted this systematic approach towards the support of Israel. Their logic and reason behind it are poor, but I agree with the suppost. Fiscal conservatism, in theory, is a good thing. It's good to make smart decisions about spending and not frivilously spend money.  The stance to support small businesses is encouraging, but a disingenuous party platform.;I think the modern Republican party has been hijacked by Christian conservatives who set policy based on their religious beliefs.

The policies he favors have led us deeper into debt, decreased our level of respect in world politics, and have proven ineffective in solving the many economic and social problems afflicting our nation.;Romney has a proven background in successful business.  He seems levelheaded and factual rather than idealistic.  I think he will attend to the business of this country (such as attending security and jobs council meetings) instead of playing golf.  While both candidates want a better economic climate, I believe Romney can and will actually do something positive about it.  No President can, by himself, solve the problems of the country, but I think Romney will provide better leadership and policies to heal the country.;-1 Inapplicable;I think the Democratic Party shows concern about social issues that I agree with.  However, I disagree strongly with many of the policies they would choose to address those issues.;I believe the Democratic Party leans toward a more centrist government.  I think they believe that many problems can be solved by more regulations and more government oversight and control. I feel they favor a society that operates on collectivism rather than individualism.  I disagree strongly with those beliefs and feel that the policies that result from them remove many of the individual rights and freedoms we have enjoyed as citizens of this country.;The Republican Party seems to me to be more responsible on fiscal matters, and more realistic.  They support business, both large and small.  They are more supportive of individual freedoms than the Democrats.  I think we need less idealism in government right now, and more realism, and the Republicans are the best ones to provide that realism.;In many ways, I feel the Republican Party has moved too far to the Right, as the Democratic Party has moved too far to the Left.  I did not like the heavy emphasis on religion during the campaigns last spring - I am a Christian, but believe strongly that religion has no place in Government.  I disagree with the far Right views on Gay people and Gay Marriage, among other items.  Extremism on either side scares me, and I think that is part of what has been tearing this country apart.

However, my main complaint is his 'don't look back' strategy when he first took office.  I believe he thought this would help promote bi-partisanship.  Big mistake.

Bush was the worst president ever and Romney will repeat many of the disastrous strategies of the Bush administration.  The country is much more likely to go to war against Iran with Romney as president.  He is also incredibly hypocritical in condemning Obama Care when it is virtually identical to Romney Care established in Massachusetts.;The democratic party is truly a big tent in that it appeals to people of all races and ethnicity.

(I am aware of political constraints on the positions he believes he may take if he wants to be re-elected.);There are many things to like about him.  He seems a bright, capable person, and reasonably well informed.  He expresses himself well, dresses nicely, and has a strong family background.  While I do not agree with his apparent religious convictions, there is little evidence of common corruptibility in his character.;I do not agree with about one hundred of his apparent positions on political issues about which I care deeply.  Also, he seems to change his expressed political positions far too easily depending on which audience he is addressing.  In that matter, he seems to me to lack integrity and political backbone.;They tend to support women's rights, gay marriage, prison reform, environmental responsibility, alternative energy, responsible use of resources, infrastructure development, fair taxation of the extremely wealthy, education, public information and other public services, and a peaceful foreign policy.  I consider these evidence of good government.;The party as a whole lacks a responsible and  consistent political platform.  I tend to support individual candidates rather than the Party as a whole.  (Republicans will come to their senses some day, and then I expect to vote for some of them.)  ('I am not a member of any organized political party.  I am a Democrat.');Republicans have a long and distinguished history of responsible and caring government.  I don't recall ever being disappointed in the official behavior of a Republican for whom I voted.  Typically, their experience in business and other large organizations like the military helped them know how to govern well.;The recent history of the Republican party has been a disaster.  At the national level and in many states and localities, the far right have seized power and forced candidates to endorse right wing positions on a multitude of issues.  In response to moderate opposition, they have allowed advisers to spin and cheat, lie and misrepresent, and oppose every proposal of the 'other side', just for the sake of opposition.  I do blame Republicans for the current out-of-control polarization and decline in the level of political discourse.  I am appalled at current Republican behavior to the point where I find it difficult to vote for any Republican at any level.  I am reluctant to trust any of them unless I know them personally, and even then I will not vote for them unless I share their political convictions.;;;;;;;;"Used computers to produce statistical reports based on health care and insurance data.Health care analyst.Keep management satisfied.";Nonprofit health care insurance company;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;;;;;;;4296;;;;-1 Inapplicable;;;hes for the common people;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;hes for the rich in society;they work for the poor;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;they wont work with the democrates because are president is black;;;;;;;;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;;;;;;;4297;Ron Paul;;;-1 Inapplicable;Ron Paul;;-1 Inapplicable;I don't believe that he is a US citizen.;-1 Inapplicable;I believe he is hostage to the 1 percent  bunch.;Concern for the less fortunate.;No concern for killing babies.;Concerned with not killing babies.;Little concern for the less fortunate.;Ron Paul;;;;;;;Civil Engineer;[REDACTED GOVERNMENT AGENCY];-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;;;;;;BBC;4298;;;;-1 Inapplicable;;;-1 Inapplicable;Tried of the lies and what he is doing about Jobs and the economy;Different he maybe able to handle it better then the current;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;They are leading us to Socialism;Capitalism is the way to go;-1 Inapplicable;;;;;;;;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;Programmer Analyst;I support Banking environment programming Finance System Controls.;Services Car Industries;;;;;;;4299;;;;-1 Inapplicable;;;He continues to support education and funding new infrastructure.;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;He completely changed his view on the majority of his policies numerous times during the campaign, to the point where he's contradicted himself.

In my opinion, the republican party typically focuses on addressing the root of the problem. For example, many economic problems can be traced to the dissolution of the family unit - kids stop performing well in school, hate and dissention usually surface, kids have no example and spend money unwisely and make other unwise decisions. Republicans would like to reduce the deficit instead of blindly allocate taxpayer money to government programs that typically fail because the root of the problem is not fixed. Democratic liberals try to promote their 'freedoms' which are actually putting Americans in chains and bondage. Republicans promote personal responsibility.;Some republicans can be a little more balanced when it comes to social issues.

Has done irreparable harm to the United States. His inexperience  and  ineptitude showed in his dicisions. He was wrong in his thought and actions on most every instance. He has not delivered on many of his promises such as transparency in government, bringing the nation together through cooperation with those who disagree with his positions, using the office of the president to force through illegal directives by edict, not abiding by the Constituion of the United States of America, increasing the national debt, not presenting a reasonable budget to Congress. Not in the least way does he attempt to work with Congress. The major responsibility of his office is to defend the United States and its sovereignty, but his inexcusable foreign policy does everything but. Instead of rolling up his sleeves and getting serious about our issues and problems, he can only blame others for his failures. Without a doubt the worst president in the last 100 years and the most danger;He has the proven record of a successful business executive. Nothing was given to him, he built his success himself. He quite obviously is a caring individual and faithful to his family, friends and country. He has a commanding presence about him, one that makes people respond positively to him.He has a remarkable memory and is a quick study.

His policies have done nothing to help the economy and has actually made it much worse by increasing the deficit and debt to historically high levels with nothing to show for those increases. His solution is to continue to blame former President Bush and continue the same policies for the next four years that have not worked.  I think it was Albert Einstein that said, 'The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result'.;Mitt Romney is a businessman.  He has experience in running businesses and his experience at Bain Capital helping turn around failing companies makes him particularly suited to make the tough decisions to help turn around the economy.;I would never vote against Mitt Romney for Barack Obama, but I do not think we should completely repeal the Affordable Care Act as Mitt Romney has proposed.  While I don't like most of the law, I do like certain provisions (pre-existing conditions, rebates of premiums if health care companies don't pay out 80 percent  on claims, etc.)  Maybe it takes repealing the entire act and then implementing certain good individual parts, but this country must have significant health care reform. The Affordable Care act was way too broad and way too much government intervention.;-1 Inapplicable;The Democratic party has become way too liberal and, dare I say, socialist.  They tend to want a strong federal government which dictates everything to the people and largely avoids states rights and a free market economy.  When I was younger, the Democratic party had 'Southern Democrats' which were somewhat a cross between moderate Democrats and Republicans.  Now the Democratic Party is nothing but mostly left wing liberals.;The Republican Party still seems to follow the constitution and stands for a smaller federal government, more states rights, a free market economy, and a strong military (which the founders said was really about the only thing the federal government should provide for with everything else left to the states).;The Republican Party has lost it's fiscal responsibility and almost spends as much federal money as the Democrats.  And, just like the Democrats, they are too concerned about keeping their jobs and unwilling to compromise.  The extreme wings of both parties have taken over, so rather than compromise, both parties do nothing as the country declines with both parties blaming each other.;;;;;;;;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;Certified Public Accountant;Accounting & Tax;-1 Inapplicable;;;;;;;4800;;;;-1 Inapplicable;;;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;;;;;;;;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;"Business AnalystData analysis and interpretation";Alcohol Distribution;Pharmacy Technician;;;;;;;reddit.com4801;;;;-1 Inapplicable;;;-1 Inapplicable;Health care, tax reform, and race.;Tax reform, health care.;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;Poor uneducated citizens.;Economic growth.;Religious properties;;;;;;;;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;Ice rink worker;College work study;File papers;;;;;;;4802;;;;-1 Inapplicable;;;-1 Inapplicable;-7 Refused;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;;;;;;;;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;;;;;;;-1 Inapplicable4803;;;;-1 Inapplicable;;;-1 Inapplicable;The economy is in shambles and there is no good outlook in the future;He is not Obama;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;They are less aligned with my basic beliefs;In general, they hold truer to my beliefs on several key issues;Like any political party, they are worried about the next election not about working on the issues honestly;;;;;;;;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;supervisor;telecommunications;-1 Inapplicable;;;;;;;4804;;;;-1 Inapplicable;;;He's slowly, but surely, bringing economy around;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;I don't like him.;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;;;;;;;;Waiting tables;Food industry;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;;;;;;;4805;;;;-1 Inapplicable;;;He is a trusting person.

I've had enough of the present presidents results to know that we need to do something. The 'Hope and Change' isn't working out for me. I'm making 50 percent  of the salary that I was the year before I voted FOR him and there are no real jobs with livable wages and benifits available so I can not move up. I also DO NOT want the GOVERNMENT controlling my healthcare. I WILL DECIDE! I also feel that government is getting too big and no longer works for the general population.If they did, we would vote on their raises and benifits. I also believe that there should be a LIFETIME TERM LIMIT on officials. They should do their terms and then go back to the private sector without any special healthcare or retirement. This would eliminate 'The Old Boys Clubs' and make things a little more fair for everyone.;;;He SEEMS to be for the middle class and wants the 'rich' to pay their share of taxes BUT, Most of the representatives are millionaires and I don't see them passing a tax on themselves so, who is blowing smoke and where?;Obamacare and not enforcing the immigration laws.;He wants to cut spending and eliminate wasting taxpayers money.;He wants to let the rich pay even less taxes.;They are for the middle class;They are too liberal with taxpayers money when it comes to government assistance for illegal aliens and those that don't have any desire to work and feel that everyone else owes them something.;They try to set budgets and keep to them.;They don't care who they step on to get ahead.;;;;;;;;-1 Inapplicable;-1 Inapplicable;Build Equipment for Industry;Mostly Material handling;Medical Records;;;;;;;6634;;;;From about the time Mitt Romney became the GOP presidential candidate.;;;He's already the president, and I think he's done pretty well so far.  Four years isn't enough time to get things done in our political system, and Obama deserves another four to finish what he's started.  Besides, Bush didn't manage to screw up our country irrevocably in the 8 years he was president, so I'm comfortable allowing Obama another 4.  And let's face it, he's pretty nice to look at during presidential addresses.;"Has he been taking the presidential debates seriously?  I mean, he might already be president, but that doesn't mean his status is secure.  Notice that Romney is inching his way up in the polls.  Obama needs to have a good long talk with his people; they are not preparing him properly.";He's been doing well in the debates and he's a republican.  I tend to agree with that party's...well, not ideals, but the general opinions associated with the less conservative republicans.  Personal property, free capitalist market and such.  Sometimes the democrats just lean too far to the bleeding-heart-liberal side.  I feel like republicans tend to side with economists on the free market economy concept, and they try to avoid messing with the system.;I think there's such a thing as being too laissez-faire.  The 1 percent  do not need to be as protected as they are:  Tax them, for god's sake.  They have money to burn, and they get richer with every minute.  When you have that much money, you get a ton in interest.  Use that to get us out of this major deficit.  And Romney?  People called Obama an elitist in the last election, but Romney has him beat by a landslide this time around.;They're liberal.  They like change, they believe in progress, they tend to make changes that reflect moving in some direction.  It's not always the right direction, but for the most part, they're not bogged down in tradition.;Sometimes, the moves they make are in the socialist direction.  I'm all for taking from the rich and giving to the poor, but can I point out that the middle class isn't rich?  If you're going to tax people to help out the poor, make sure the people you're taxing are actually rich enough to handle it, and make sure the poor you're helping deserve it and aren't just manipulating the system to avoid getting off their asses and doing something about their lives.;They believe that you deserve to own what you earn.  They are about capitalism and not interfering in people's lives.  They are about going out and getting what you want, but within the confines of your economic status.  You can achieve the American dream, but only if you can actually afford it.;They are kind of bogged down in tradition.  They don't seem to like progress and moving anywhere.  They seem to depend pretty heavily on how things have always been.  Yes, let's depend upon the Constitution, but let's try to interpret it in the context of NOW, not how the founding fathers considered it back then.  Things have changed a bit since then:  For example, women can vote (which I consider a good thing) and people don't own slaves anymore (another step in the right direction).
